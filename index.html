  <h1 id="title">Map of Armed and Unarmed Police Shootings</h1>
    <h2>What this Map Shows?</h2>
        <p>This map shows the crowdsourced police shootings data retrieved from <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/deadspin-police-shooting-database-update-were-still-go-1627414202">Deadspin Police Shooting Database</a> last fall. It shows the locations of police shootings for armed and unarmed people. The information also consists of the date, race, whether the individual survived, and a summary of the incident.</p>
    <h2>Why it is Important?</h3>
        <p>This is some very sensitive information and it can be difficult to imagine where various police shootings can occur, so an interactive map can showcase a record of the shootings from a visual perspective. In this zoomed up view of my map, the blue marker indicates my city, and the blue polygon indicates the cities closest to where I live, where police shootings have occurred. This can help me compare the amount of police-shootings in other cities within the vicinity compared to mine. These cities include Woodinville, Bellevue, Seattle, and one is very close to where I live in Shoreline.</p>
