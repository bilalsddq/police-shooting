  <h1 id="title">Map of Armed and Unarmed Police Shootings</h1>
    <h2>What this Map Shows?</h2>
        <p>This map shows the crowdsourced police shootings data retrieved from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cEGQ3eAFKpFBVq1k2mZIy5mBPxC6nBTJHzuSWtZQSVw/edit#gid=1144428085">Deadspin Police Shooting Database</a> last fall. It shows the locations of police shootings for armed and unarmed people. Armed shootings are indicated by a red handgun icon, and unarmed shootings are indicated by a blue palm icon. The information also consists of the date, race, whether the person survived, and a summary of the incident.</p>
    <h2>Why it is Important?</h3>
        <p>This is some very sensitive information and it can be difficult to imagine where various police shootings can occur, so an interactive map can showcase a record of the shootings from a visual perspective.<p>
